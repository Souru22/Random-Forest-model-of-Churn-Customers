# Random-Forest-model-of-Churn-Customers
- This project aimed to identify potential churn customers of a company by using the Random Forest Classification Model. 
- The project was written in Python and utilized various machine learning libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Sklearn.
- The main objective of this project was to analyze the churn data of a company and develop a model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
- The churn status was classified as either 'Yes' or 'No', and the model was trained on a dataset consisting of various factors that may affect a customer's churn behavior.
- During the project, various data visualization techniques were employed to gain insights into the data and identify the factors that may contribute to a customer's churn behavior.
- The Random Forest Algorithm was used to build the classification model and achieved a high accuracy rate.
- This project serves as a good example of how machine learning algorithms can be used to identify potential churn customers and how data visualization techniques can be employed to gain insights into the data. 
- It can be used as a reference for individuals interested in working with classification models or in the customer retention domain.
